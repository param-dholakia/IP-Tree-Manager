# IP-Tree-Manager
A simple C-based IP Address Management System using a binary search tree for efficient storage, retrieval, and deletion of IP addresses.

# IP Address Management System

The **IP Address Management System** is a C-based program that uses a Binary Search Tree (BST) to manage IP addresses. It allows efficient storage, retrieval, deletion, and validation of IP addresses, making it a reliable tool for organizing network data.

## Features

- **Insert IP Address:** Add a valid IP address to the binary search tree.
- **Search IP Address:** Check if a specific IP address exists in the tree.
- **Delete IP Address:** Remove an IP address from the tree while maintaining tree structure.
- **Display IP Addresses:** View all stored IP addresses in sorted order.
- **Validation:** Ensures only valid IPv4 addresses are accepted.

## Highlights

- Implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) for efficient operations.
- Includes a robust IP address validation mechanism.
- Handles memory allocation errors gracefully.
- User-friendly menu-driven interface.

## Project Structure

- **Binary Search Tree (BST):** Used for managing IP addresses.
- **Validation:** Ensures only valid IPv4 addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.1`) are allowed.
- **Traversal:** Supports in-order traversal to display IPs in sorted order.
